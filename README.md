# Functionalized Cellulose
Scripts written to facilitate and analyze the functionalization of Cellulose nanocrystals and pABA ligands.

## Getting Started

The aim of this project is to group all the scripts used to functionalize cellulose nanocrystals for molecular dynamics simulations. These scripts are written in Python 2.3 and work together with wolffia (https://github.com/compMathUPRH/wolffia). The goal of this work is to study the interaction between pABA functionalized crystals and selected proteins by means of molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD.

## Prerequisites

To run these scripts you will need to clone wolffia from https://github.com/compMathUPRH/wolffia and export the path to the location of this project. To run wolffia in Ubuntu you will need to install:
```
sudo apt-get install python python-qt4-gl python-qwt5-qt4 pyqt4-dev-tools python-openbabel python-networkx python-opengl sshpass
```

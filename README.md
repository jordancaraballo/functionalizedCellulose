# Functionalized Cellulose
Scripts written to facilitate and analyze the functionalization of Cellulose nanocrystals and pABA ligands

## Getting Started

The aim of this project is to group all the scripts used to functionalize cellulose nanocrystals for molecular dynamics simulations. These scripts are written in Python 2.3 work together Wolffia's project (https://github.com/compMathUPRH/wolffia).
The goal of this work is to study the interaction between pABA functionalized crystals and selected proteins by means of molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD.

## Prerequisites

To run these scripts you will need to clone Wolffia project from https://github.com/compMathUPRH/wolffia and export the path to the location of this project. To get more specific instructions refer to each script individually.
